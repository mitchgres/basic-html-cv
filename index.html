    <!---
        You can change the way which elements are dispalyed an make elements like <p> display as Inline with the display selector in CSS.

        Block Elements - Block Other Elements From Sitting Next To It (Left / Right)
            - Common Block Elements: <p> <h1> <div> <ol> <ul> <li> <form>
        
        Inline Element - Only Takes Up As Much Space As It Needs To & Can Be Use Inside Block Elements Like <p> & Appear Next To Each Other
            - Common Inline Elements: <span> <img> <a>
            - Drawback: You are unable to specify width, even know your able to with Block Elements

        Inline Block Element - Best Of Both Worlds w/ Inline & Block As You Can Specify Width & Also Use Them On The Same Line

        None - Doesn't Show Element. Pretends Like It Doesn't Exist In Website.
                - You can also use the visibility selector and it will make the element disappear visually, though the document will still act like its there e.g if you hid a word in a 
                  paragraph the word will still look like it is there, but you won't be able to see it.

<!-- Predefined Rules About CSS Positioning
    1. Content Is Everything
        - For example with block elements height is determined by content and in inline then width and height is determined by content.
    2. Order Comes From Code
        - How you structure your HTML File will determine how it is displayed. e.g. if you put an image at the top of your website then it'll display first.
    3. Children Sit On Top Of Parents
        - If you put a child inside a parent element like a <div> then the child elements lets say a <p> will go on top of the parent, by default they will be on top of parent using the 
            z axis.
        - You can use the position selector to change the default layout, there are four types.
            - Static - Go along w/ HTML Rules (Only HTML)
            - Realative - Positions elements we select realative to how it would have been positioned had it been static. 
                - Example:
                    img {
                        position: relative
                        left: 30px
                    }
                    */ this will push the element 30px to the right of where it would have been if the image were to be static */
                        - You can move from top, bottom, left, and right. <-- Coordinate Properties
                        - Realative elements movement doesn't change the behavior of the webpage. e.g website behaves like it was static, but visually it moves. 
                        - Acts simliar to margins. e.g top: 30px == margin-top: 30px
            - Absolute - Positionin an element realative to its parent element. So if you ave a picture inside a parent with a right: 30px instead of moving 30px to the left, it'll appear 30px from the right
                        side of the parent element. In absolute the change in element does change the flow of the document.
            - Fixed - Is fixed to the viewport window, as you scroll though the webpage it stays in the same postion. Follows that user as they scroll through the webpage.
